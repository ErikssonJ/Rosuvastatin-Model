## Rosuvastatin-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1/OATP1B3/BCRP DDI victim drug)

### Repository files
Within this repository, we share a whole-body PBPK model of rosuvastatin that has been carefully developed using 42 clinical studies of intravenous or oral administration, covering a broad dosing range (0.002–80.0 mg). 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations and the observed data of all clinical studies used for model development and evaluation. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].

### Version information
